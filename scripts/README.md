# Completion generation script
This script generates a list of completions for all files listed in `classes.txt`.

To add support for your own MineTweaker/CraftTweaker addon.
Please add your link to a file annotated with`@ZenClass` to the `classes.txt` file.

Currently has all classes added by [ModTweaker](https://github.com/jaredlll08/ModTweaker).
